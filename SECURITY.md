# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

These versions will be enforced with security auditing for use as dependecies and recognition archival use. Manual signed verification is necessary to build or use as dependencies unless approved by downstream users each time a build of theirs is submitted or deployed. You can also appeal this process, however, certain public facing platforms will not be able to distribute this code.
